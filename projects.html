                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>(This is a Group Project for my CPSC 491 class.) This is a mobile application "Task Manager" that aims to help families that have children who suffer from Autism in their daily lives. This app allows the parent(s) to assign daily tasks to thier child and is able to add, edit and delete tasks, as well as being able to send notifications and see reports & data on critical information. The child will be engaged with a gamified version of the application which will hold their focus and give them motivation to complete their daily tasks in a non-traditional way. </p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> The technologies we used in this application were X-code, Swift and database. </p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The main challenge from this project was the lack of experience. I had to do my fair share of research and reference educational resources to get a fundamental understanding of the Ios System as well as the Swift programming language. </p>
                    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> This aplpication is still being worked on and will be completed by June 2025! When it is finished we hope to be able to see the impact it has on families and release its final version to the public. </p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This was my first project using the macOS system and Swift Programming Language. This is a simple color app where a user is able to see a image view of a color they are able to customize. The app provides the user the ability to toggle a color on or off. It also allows the user to fine tune the color with sliders, and lastly it allows a user to use a text box to manually enter the number of each color. The app also allows the user to reset the color altogether to have a fresh page.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> I was able to make this app using X-code and Swift Programming Language.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The greatest challenge for me while programming this app was the lack of knowledge about swift. After doing some research i was able to add even more features such as persistence. This is where a user is able to have values and even if they tab out of the app or exit completely the app will still have the same values when it was closed out or tabbed out.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> I was able to make a functional app that works and was also able to add more features then i was planning. This was a very good learning project for me and another project i am able to add to my portfolio. </p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a Random Trivia Quiz Application. It was an assignment for one of my classes. This app is essentially a random trivia quiz. The app allows the user to start a quiz, the user is then prompted to select a number of questions from 5 all the way up to 20. The app will display the question along with possible answers a user is able to select. If the user selects the correct answer it will pop up in green and their score will increment by 1. If the user selects a wrong answer the incorrect selection will be red and the correct answer will be highlighted as well in the color green to indicate the correct answer. At the end of the quiz the results will be displayed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> This app was made using macOS and X-code with Swift being the programming language. I also used an API to get the questions, however it's far from perfect as i found a free online one since i didnt want to come out of pocket for this app. Hopefully in the future i can upgrade and make this app even better.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> This app did bring a new set of challenges, i was very unfamiliar with the API and how to utilize it correctly. After getting over that hurdle the rest of the app fell into place.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The app came out amazing and fully functional. I do want to keep working on it and make it even better. I plan on updating the API and adding categories as well as other features.</p>
